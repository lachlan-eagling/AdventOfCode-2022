# AdventOfCode 2022

Taking on this years advent of code challenges as a learning project for Rust.

Very much taking the "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" approach, my main goal is to explore the Rust language features and implement working solutions, then to come back and make them more performant and idiomatic once I am able to implement unit tests with the known correct output.
